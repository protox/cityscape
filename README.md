# Cityscape
**Action Quake2 / AQtion Map**

Put .pkz file into your action directory, for example if using AQtion
Place **cityscape.pkz** into **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AQtion\action**
Then load AQ2 / AQtion and in console (press ~ to load console) type **map cityscape**, or **gamemap cityscape**

I've included the .map file for learning purposes, it can be edited in Trenchbroom map editor.
cityscape.pkz is the final release, first release was cityscape01 and number kept increasing until final release.
pkz is just a zip container which can be unzipped using 7zip or similar.
