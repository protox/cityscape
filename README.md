# Cityscape
**Action Quake2 / AQtion Map** (Work In Progress)

Put .pkz file into your action directory, for example if using AQtion
Place **cityscape01.pkz** into **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AQtion\action**
Then load AQ2 / AQtion and in console (press ~ to load console) type **map cityscape01**, or **gamemap cityscape01**

I've included the .map file for learning purposes, it can be edited in Trenchbroom map editor.
When the map is finished I will just name it cityscape, for now I have added a number at the end, starting with 01 as first release and will continue increasing.
